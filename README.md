BBHTTP
======

BBHTTP is a rich wrapper for **libcurl** written in Objective-C.

It is an ARC-only library that uses [features](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ObjectiveCLiterals.html) introduced by Clang 3.1. Thus, it is only suitable for iOS 5+ and OSX 10.7+.

It boasts an extremely simple and compact interface that allows you to reduce your code to fire off HTTP requests down to a couple of clean lines, while preserving full flexibility should you ever need it.

```objc
[[BBHTTPRequest readResource:@"http://foo.bar/baz"] execute:^(BBHTTPResponse* r) {
     NSLog(@"Finished: %u %@ -- received %u bytes of '%@'.",
           r.code, r.message, r.contentSize, r[@"Content-Type"]);
 } error:^(NSError* e) {
     NSLog(@"Request failed: %@", [e localizedDescription]);
 }];

// Finished: 200 OK -- received 68364 bytes of 'text/html'.
```

At this stage there are still a lot of rough edges to polish, bugs to fix and features missing to bring it up-to-par with other similar projects. I want to add those over time but help is always more than welcome so be sure to open issues for the features you'd love to see or drop me a mention [@biasedbit](http://twitter.com/biasedbit) on Twitter.

The API is **very** likely to keep mutating until this reaches 1.0.


## Highlights

* Concise asynchronous-driven usage:

    ```objc
    [[BBHTTPRequest deleteResource:@"http://foo.bar/baz/1"] execute:^(BBHTTPResponse* r) {
        // handle response
    } error:nil]];
    ```

    > You don't even need to keep references to the requests, just fire and forget.


* Handy common usage patterns:

    ```objc
    [[BBHTTPRequest readResource:@"http://foo.bar/baz/1"] setup:^(id request) {
        // Prepare request...
    } execute:^(BBHTTPResponse* response) {
        // Handle response...
    } error:^(NSError* error) {
        // Handle error...
    } finally:^{
        // Do after error OR success.
    }];


* Get JSON effortlessly:

    ```objc
    [[[BBHTTPRequest readResource:@"http://foo.bar/baz.json"] asJSON] execute:^(BBHTTPResponse* r) {
        NSLog(@"User email: %@", r.content[@"user.email"]);
        NSLog(@"# of followers: %@", r.content[@"user.followers.@count"]);
    } error:^(NSError* error) {
        // Handle request *or* JSON decoding error
    }];
    ```

    > Notice the keyed subscript operator behaves as `valueForKeyPath:` rather than `valueForKey:`. That's because JSON responses that would yield a `NSDictionary` get wrapped by `BBJSONDictionary`.
    > Read more about the collection operators [here](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/Articles/CollectionOperators.html).

* Images too:

    ```objc
    [[BBHTTPRequest readResource:@"http://foo.bar/baz.png"] setup:^(id request) {
        [request downloadContentAsImage];
    } execute:^(BBHTTPResponse* response) {
        UIImage* image = response.content; // NSImage on OSX
        NSLog(@"image size: %@", NSStringFromCGSize(image.size));
    } error:nil];
    ```

    > This example uses `downloadContentAsImage` on the `setup` block to setup the image download & conversion but you could also use the fluent syntax alternative (`asImage`), just like on the JSON example above.

* Stream uploads from a `NSInputStream` or directly from a file:

    ```objc
    [[BBHTTPRequest createResource:@"http://foo.bar/baz" withContentsOfFile:@"/path/to/file"]
     setup:^(BBHTTPRequest* request) {
         request[@"Extra-Header"] = @"something else";
     } execute:^(BBHTTPResponse* response) {
         // handle response
     } error:nil];
    ```

    > The request's content type and content length headers will be automatically set based on the file's properties.


* Download to memory buffers or stream directly to file/`NSOutputStream`:

    ```objc
    [[BBHTTPRequest readResource:@"http://foo.bar/baz"] setup:^(BBHTTPRequest* request) {
        [request downloadToFile:@"/path/to/file"];
    } execute:^(BBHTTPResponse* response) {
        // handle response
    } error:nil];
    ```

    > No need to delete the file if the download fails midway; BBHTTP will take care of keeping everything clean.


* A *power-dev* API when you need that extra bit of control:

    ```objc
    BBHTTPExecutor* twitterExecutor = [BBHTTPExecutor initWithId:@"twitter.com"];
    BBHTTPExecutor* facebookExecutor = [BBHTTPExecutor initWithId:@"facebook.com"];
    twitterExecutor.maxParallelRequests = 10;
    facebookExecutor.maxParallelRequests = 2;
    ...
    BBHTTPRequest* request = [[BBHTTPRequest alloc]
                              initWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://twitter.com/resource"]
                              andVerb:@"GET"];

    request[@"Accept-Language"] = @"en-us";
    request.downloadProgressBlock = ^(NSUInteger current, NSUInteger total) { /* ... */ };
    request.finishBlock = ^(BBHTTPRequest* request) { /* ... */ };

    [twitterExecutor executeRequest:request];
    ```

There are other built-in ways to handle content from responses. Be sure to read up the [In-depth guide to response content handling](https://github.com/brunodecarvalho/BBHTTP/wiki/Response-content-handling).

## Why?

You mean other than its sleek API or the fact that it uses libcurl underneath?

Well, unlike `NSURLConnection` and, consequently, any lib that relies on it, BBHTTP...

* is strictly compliant with [section 8.2.3](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-8.2.3) of RFC 2616, a.k.a. the misbeloved `Expect: 100-Continue` header;
* can receive server error responses midway through upload &mdash; as opposed to continuing to pump data into socket eden, and eventually reporting connection timeout instead of the actual error response sent by the server.

*"But my uploads work just fine..."*

* If you only wrote code that uploads to a server, you've probably never noticed either of the above;
* If you wrote both client *and* server-side code to handle uploads, chances are that you never ran into either of the above either;
* If you're hardcore and wrote your own server *and* client *and* noticed `NSURLConnection` ignores errors until it finishes its upload, then this is the HTTP framework for you. Also, fistbump for writing your server and client. And paying attention to the specs.

On a more serious tone, the motivation for this libcurl wrapper was that during development of [Droplr](http://droplr.com)'s API server, we noticed that whenever the API rejected an upload and immediately closed the connection &mdash; which is a perfectly legal & reasonable behavior &mdash; the Cocoa-based clients would keep reporting upload progress (even though I **knew** the socket was closed) and eventually fail with "Request timeout", instead of the response the server had sent down the pipes.

This meant that:

1. `NSURLConnection` wasn't waiting for the `100-Continue` provisional response before sending along the request body;
2. `NSURLConnection` wasn't realizing that a response was already sent and the connection was dying until it finished uploading what it had to upload. *stubborn bastard, eh?*

I did file a bug report but after a year of waiting for a response, I decided to come up with a working alternative. Coincidentally, the same day I let this library out in the open, I got a reply from Apple &mdash; closing the bug as a duplicate of some other I don't have access to.

A couple of quick tests with command line version of curl proved that curl knew how to properly handle these edge cases so it was time to build a new HTTP framework for Cocoa.

> During that process, [this handy build script](https://github.com/brunodecarvalho/curl-ios-build-scripts) was produced, so even if you don't want to use this library but are still interested in getting curl running on iOS, do check it out!


## Dependencies

* `libcurl` (read below)
* `libz.dylib`
* `Security.framework`
* `CoreServices.framework` on OSX, `MobileCoreServices.framework` on iOS
* `AppKit.framework` on OSX, `UIKit.framework` on iOS

> **Note:** You can find libcurl 7.30.0 binaries and headers under `Build/iOS/Static lib/libcurl` and `Build/OSX/Static lib/libcurl`. There are two versions for iOS, compiled against 6.1 SDK. `libcurl.iOS.dev.a` has support for for i386 (simulator), armv7 and armv7s (iPhone 3GS and newer) while `libcurl.iOS.appstore.a` only has support for arm architectures &mdash; making it smaller in size and thus optimized for releases. The OSX version was compiled against 10.8 SDK with support for x86_64 (64 bit Intel). If you'd like to build your own custom version, try [this](https://github.com/brunodecarvalho/curl-ios-build-scripts).
> All binaries are compiled with debug symbols so even though they appear large, they'll end up with 400~600KB.


## Documentation

For guides on how to setup and start working with this lib, check out [the wiki pages](https://github.com/brunodecarvalho/BBHTTP/wiki).

The project also includes comprehensive class-level documentation. If you happen to have [appledoc](https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc) installed, just run the `generate` script on the `Docs` folder and it'll create html documentation for you under `Docs/html`.
